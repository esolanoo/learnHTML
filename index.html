      <h2>About Western Honey Bees</h2>
      <p>The western honey bee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) is the most common of the 7â€“12 species of honey bees worldwide. 
        The genus name Apis is Latin for "bee", and mellifera is the Latin for "honey-bearing" or "honey carrying".
        Its conservation status is currently <strong>Threatened</strong>.<br /><br /> Although they are declared as extinct in the wild on some continents.
      <h3>Subspecies</h3>
      <p>
        There are over 31 recognized subspecies, from which the ones I like te most are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ligustica</li>
        <li>Carnica</li>
        <li>Caucasia</li>
        <li>Mellifera</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>The western honey bee is eusocial, creating colonies with a single fertile female (or "queen"), many normally non-reproductive females or "workers", 
        and a small proportion of fertile males or "drones". Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees. Colony activities are organized by complex 
        communication between individuals, through both pheromones and the <strong>dance language</strong>.</p>
